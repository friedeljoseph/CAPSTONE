The code in this file is for the USD Capstone project "Support Vector Machine and CNN Development and Iterations for RF Signal Image Classification",
completed 2025-08-11 for Professor Anna Marbut, by the Project Team consisting of Joseph Friedel, Bilal Najar, and Daniel Shifrin.
Two models were developed.  One was a CNN, using all the database (400 sample in 31 categories) with augmentation to balance the dataset, 
while the other modol is a SVM using multiple feature extraction methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), 
as well as combinations, thereof, to improve classification accuracy and robustness.  The SVM uses a compact CNN model, as a baseline for comparison.
